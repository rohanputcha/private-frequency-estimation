# Locally Differential Private Succinct Sketches for Frequency Estimation

Frequency estimation in data streams is a founda- tional problem in computer science and data analysis. The goal is to efficiently determine the approximate frequency of items in data streams where storage and computational resources are limited. In this project, we propose a novel approach to frequency estimation that prioritizes privacy preservation by utilizing Count- Min Sketch (CMS) and local differential privacy (LDP) techniques for a distributed setting, i.e., an untrusted central server that aims to analyze the frequency of items according to multiple clients. Experiments are done on the proposed LDP-CMS to analyze the performance in terms of different privacy guarantee levels.
